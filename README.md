This is my push swap:

To run it, u need to get the  mlx library from Intra, then extract it, put it in the root folder, and then rename it to mlx. Then it should be fine to run. Once I'm finished with the project, I will add the mlx library here myself.
The reason we removed mlx here because it will trigger too many norm errors. Some of the seniors said that it's better to leave it and let the evaluator get from the intra so that they won't think I edited the mlx itself, so yeah, sorry for the inconvenience. 

Other than that, the project is perfect, no prob. It's a knight gathering potions and escaping. That's all. Have fun, I have many maps in there. I think the maze and large map will be too big for the laptop or PC, but the Mac works just fine. If you want to see, I'll add the screenshot here

So yeah, other than that tester passed, and yeah, all good, norm good too =>
